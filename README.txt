Dinner Party

Dinner Party is a mobile web app I created to make Dinner Parties with friends.
The app asks you to choose how many people you are inviting and which type of cuisine you would like to prepare.
Once chosen, you will have an array of images showing you the final product of what you will be preparing. When you press the images, a list of ingredients will appear, accompanied by the instructions.
At the bottom of the Dishes you will see a Map indicating the closest marketplaces you could get the ingredients for the dinner party, and the price in each market place.
** a new feature will be to request delivery for these items straight to your home.
